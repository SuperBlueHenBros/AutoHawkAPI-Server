# Lua Socket Server and API for Bizhawk

The Lua socket server usually extracted by Bizhook for use with [AutoHawk](https://github.com/SuperBlueHenBros/middle-tier) in via [AutoHawk-API-Client](https://github.com/SuperBlueHenBros/Bizhook). 

## Information

hook.lua is a based on OpenDisrupt's Bizhook library but is not compatible with the original API located on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/OpenDisrupt/bizhook). Please don't bother them regarding any issues encountered when using this fork. This implementation has been completely reworked to support manual frame advancement and automated input as supported in [our fork of the Bizhook API](https://github.com/SuperBlueHenBros/Bizhook). Full credit to [Maximillian Strand](https://gitlab.com/deepadmax) and [Autumn](https://github.com/rosemash/luape) for getting this originally working. 

## Usage

### Manual

Open and run with Bizhawk's Lua console

### Automatic

Automatically launched with Bizhawk via [AutoHawk](https://github.com/SuperBlueHenBros/middle-tier) once configured.
